Hello! Welcome to SpadeAce. To get started press the start button which will open up a new SpadeAce Game.
In case you've never played before, the objective of SpadeAce is to stack all of the cards by suit in ascending
order, from the ace to the king. There are seven piles of cards on the table and a draw pile. In order to reveal 
new cards, stack the visible cards in descending order with alternating suit colours. For example, if the top card
in a pile is an eight of diamonds, the next card on the pile must be a seven of clubs or spades. If you run out of
moves, draw a card. If you run out of moves and cards to draw you have lost the game. If a pile becomes empty, you 
may move a new card into that pile.
To move a card, enter the rank and the first letter of the card's suit in the first textbox. In the second textbox 
enter the pile number which corresponds with the pile you want to move the card to, then press submit. Make sure
you don't press submit twice. To draw a card, press the face down card in the top right corner. You can access 
any of the revealed draw pile cards at any time. Once you have won the game, press check win. Those are all of
the rules. If you need to access them during the game press the help button on the bottom right. Have fun!
